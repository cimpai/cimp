# Governance

This document defines how the CIMP framework evolves.

CIMP governance prioritizes stability, clarity, and long-term integrity over speed or consensus.

---

## Authority

CIMP has a **maintainer-led governance model**.

Canonical decisions regarding:
- core concepts
- terminology
- lifecycle definitions
- philosophical boundaries

are made by the **CIMP Maintainers**.

This is intentional.

CIMP is not governed by popularity or voting.

---

## Scope of governance

Governance applies to:
- definitions of core concepts
- changes to the conceptual model
- interpretation of framework boundaries
- acceptance of new canonical documents

Governance does **not** apply to:
- external tools or implementations
- private or experimental forks
- internal usage adaptations

---

## Decision process

Decisions are made through:
- documented proposals
- explicit rationale
- consideration of long-term impact

Breaking changes to concepts require:
- clear motivation
- migration guidance
- explicit acknowledgment of impact

Silently redefining concepts is not allowed.

---

## Stability guarantees

CIMP prioritizes **conceptual stability**.

Once a concept is introduced and documented as canonical:
- its meaning should not drift
- its removal requires strong justification
- backward compatibility is preferred

Change is allowed.  
Untracked drift is not.

---

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome in the form of:
- clarifications
- examples
- improvements in explanation
- identification of inconsistencies

Conceptual changes require alignment with CIMP philosophy.

Maintainers reserve the right to decline contributions that:
- dilute core principles
- introduce ambiguity
- reframe CIMP as a tool or product

---

## Forks and adaptations

CIMP explicitly allows forks and adaptations.

If you modify:
- definitions
- lifecycle models
- governance rules

you must clearly state deviations from the canonical framework.

This protects both the fork and the original.

---

## Accountability

Governance decisions are documented.

There are no anonymous canonical changes.

Every decision has:
- an author
- a rationale
- a traceable history
