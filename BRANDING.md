# CIMP Branding Guide

This document defines the canonical brand system for CIMP.

CIMP branding is intentionally minimal, technical, and calm.  
It is designed to communicate **control, boundaries, and trust**, not emotion or hype.

CIMP does not try to look impressive.  
It tries to look reliable.

---

## Brand principles

CIMP branding is guided by the following principles:

- control through boundaries, not force
- human accountability first
- systems over features
- clarity over decoration
- longevity over trend

CIMP should feel:
- infrastructural
- governance-oriented
- enterprise-safe
- long-lived

---

## Tone and voice

CIMP uses a **neutral, precise, and restrained tone**.

Preferred qualities:
- calm
- factual
- explicit
- non-promotional

Avoid:
- marketing language
- emotional framing
- exaggerated claims
- promises of safety or speed

CIMP explains.  
It does not persuade.

---

## Language

- Canonical language: **English**
- Terminology must be consistent across all documents
- Concepts are capitalized when referring to canonical definitions (e.g. Intent, Change, Incident)

Avoid synonyms for core concepts.  
Precision matters more than variety.

## Use of emojis

Emojis are **not part of the CIMP brand**.

They may be used only as **functional markers**, not as decoration.

Allowed:
- 👉 as a navigational pointer before links

Not allowed:
- emotional or expressive emojis
- emojis in headings
- emojis in philosophical or conceptual statements
- emojis used for emphasis or branding

If in doubt, do not use an emoji.

---

## Typography and formatting

CIMP favors readability over style.

Guidelines:
- plain Markdown
- no visual separators for decoration
- minimal emphasis (bold only when necessary)
- no ASCII art
- no badges unless strictly informational

Documents should read well in raw text form.

---

## Visual identity

CIMP visual identity is minimal and symbolic.

General direction:
- neutral colors
- no gradients
- no illustrations
- no mascots
- no anthropomorphic elements

Visuals, when used, should communicate **structure and boundaries**, not motion or excitement.

---

## Naming conventions

- Repository names are lowercase and hyphenated
- Files use clear, descriptive names
- Avoid playful or metaphorical naming

Examples:
- `change-lifecycle.md`
- `architecture-memory.md`
- `incident-report.md`

---

## Consistency over creativity

CIMP prioritizes consistency.

Creativity is welcome in:
- examples
- discussions
- adaptations

The core framework must remain stable and predictable.

---

## Final note

Branding is a form of governance.

Every visual or stylistic choice communicates intent.

When in doubt, choose the option that looks  
**boring, calm, and durable**.
