# Decisions

A Decision is an **explicit commitment** made under uncertainty.

Decisions connect Intent to Change and assign responsibility.

## What a Decision is

A Decision:
- chooses one option among alternatives
- accepts specific trade-offs
- commits the system to a direction
- has an identifiable owner

Decisions exist even when undocumented.  
CIMP makes them explicit.

---

## What a Decision is not

A Decision is not:
- consensus
- a vague agreement
- an implementation detail
- a post-hoc justification

“Everyone agreed” is not a Decision.

---

## Why Decisions must be fixed

Undocumented Decisions disappear.

When they disappear:
- alternatives are reconsidered repeatedly
- the same debates resurface
- responsibility becomes unclear
- incidents lack context

Fixing Decisions preserves intent across time.

---

## Decision ownership

Every Decision must have:
- a single accountable owner
- a clear scope
- an explicit rationale

Many people may contribute.

One person decides.

---

## Decisions under uncertainty

Decisions are made without complete information.

This is expected.

A good Decision:
- states assumptions
- acknowledges uncertainty
- accepts bounded risk

Waiting for certainty is itself a Decision.

---

## Decision records

Decisions should be recorded in a minimal, durable form.

A Decision record typically includes:
- context
- decision statement
- alternatives considered
- rationale
- consequences
- owner
- date

Brevity is a virtue.

---

## Decisions vs implementation

Implementation may evolve.

The Decision remains stable unless explicitly revisited.

Changing implementation does not automatically change the Decision.

Changing the Decision requires a new Decision.

---

## Decisions and Change

Changes without Decisions rely on implicit authority.

Explicit Decisions:
- clarify why a Change exists
- explain why some risks were accepted
- enable honest incident analysis

Without Decisions, Change becomes guesswork.

---

## Decisions and incidents

After an Incident, Decisions become evidence.

They allow teams to ask:
- was the Decision reasonable at the time?
- were assumptions invalid?
- were consequences acceptable?

Without Decisions, post-incident analysis turns speculative.

---

## Decision drift

Decision drift occurs when:
- implementation diverges silently
- constraints erode
- ownership is lost

Drift is prevented by:
- explicit records
- periodic review
- visible ownership

---

## Final note

Decisions do not need to be perfect.

They need to be **remembered**.
