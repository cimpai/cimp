# Architecture Memory

Systems remember behavior.

People remember intent.

When people leave, intent is lost.

Architecture Memory exists to preserve **why the system is the way it is**,  
not just **how it works today**.

---

## What architecture memory is

Architecture Memory is the accumulated record of:
- Intent behind Changes
- decisions and trade-offs
- accepted risks
- incidents and their lessons

It is not documentation of structure.

It is documentation of **reasoning**.

---

## What architecture memory is not

Architecture Memory is not:
- API documentation
- system diagrams
- code comments
- onboarding guides

Those describe *what exists*.

Architecture Memory explains *why it exists*.

---

## Why memory matters

Complex systems outlive individuals and teams.

Without memory:
- changes appear arbitrary
- old mistakes are repeated with new justifications
- risk accumulates invisibly
- confidence decays

Every undocumented decision creates future friction.

---

## Memory vs documentation

Documentation describes current state.

Memory preserves **historical context**.

A system can be well-documented  
and still impossible to change safely.

Without memory, documentation lies by omission.

---

## How memory is lost

Architecture Memory is lost when:
- decisions are made in private channels
- intent is implied but not written
- incidents are “fixed” but not integrated
- context exists only in senior engineers’ heads

Time erodes undocumented reasoning.

---

## How Changes accumulate

Each Change modifies:
- system behavior
- constraints
- risk profile
- failure modes

Without memory, these modifications stack blindly.

The system becomes fragile not because of complexity,  
but because of forgotten assumptions.

---

## Memory as a governance function

Preserving memory is not an archival task.

It is a governance responsibility.

Memory enables:
- safer future changes
- faster onboarding
- better incident response
- honest trade-off evaluation

---

## Minimal memory artifacts

Effective Architecture Memory does not require volume.

Minimal artifacts include:
- Intent statements
- Change Plans
- recorded Decisions
- Incident analyses
- links between them

Quality matters more than completeness.

---

## Memory across time

Architecture Memory must survive:
- team rotation
- organizational change
- growth and scaling
- crises and incidents

If memory depends on individuals, it will fail.

---

## Memory and culture

Architecture Memory enforces a cultural constraint:

> If a decision matters, it must be rememberable.

This discourages:
- impulsive change
- undocumented risk
- silent trade-offs

---

## Final observation

Systems do not forget.

They carry the consequences of past decisions forever.

Only humans forget.

CIMP exists to make systems remember what humans cannot.
