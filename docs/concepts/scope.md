# Scope

Scope defines **the boundaries of a Change**.

It explicitly states what may change  
and what must not change.

Scope limits unintended consequences.

---

## What Scope is

Scope defines:
- the parts of the system affected by a Change
- the parts explicitly excluded
- the conceptual and operational boundaries of work

Scope answers the question:

> “Where does this Change end?”

---

## What Scope is not

Scope is not:
- a task list
- a technical decomposition
- a timeline
- an implementation plan

Scope describes **boundaries**, not activities.

---

## In scope vs out of scope

A valid Scope always contains both:

**In scope:**
- what is allowed to change
- what is intentionally affected

**Out of scope:**
- what must remain unchanged
- what is intentionally excluded

If something is not explicitly out of scope,  
it is implicitly at risk.

---

## Why Scope matters

Without explicit Scope:
- “small changes” expand silently
- unrelated improvements are mixed in
- risk grows without visibility

Scope creep is not a discipline problem.  
It is a boundary problem.

---

## Scope and Intent

Intent defines **why** a Change exists.

Scope defines **where** that Intent is allowed to act.

Intent without Scope is unbounded authority.

---

## Scope and governance

Scope is a governance control.

It:
- limits blast radius
- protects invariants
- enables focused review
- simplifies rollback decisions

Changing Scope is itself a Change.

---

## Scope under pressure

Under urgency, Scope is often relaxed first.

This is when it matters most.

If Scope cannot be stated clearly,  
the Change is not ready.

---

## Final note

Scope does not restrict progress.

It protects it from unintended expansion.
