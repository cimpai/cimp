# Kill Criteria

Kill Criteria define **conditions under which a Change must be stopped, rolled back, or reconsidered**, regardless of effort already invested.

They protect systems from continuing changes that are no longer justified.

---

## What Kill Criteria are

Kill Criteria are:
- explicit stop conditions
- defined *before or during* execution
- independent of sunk cost
- enforced by governance, not emotion

Kill Criteria answer the question:

> “Under what conditions must we stop this Change?”

---

## What Kill Criteria are not

Kill Criteria are not:
- rollback plans
- risk descriptions
- monitoring alerts
- post-hoc justifications

Rollback describes *how* to revert.  
Kill Criteria describe *when continuing is no longer acceptable*.

---

## Why Kill Criteria matter

Without Kill Criteria:
- effort becomes a justification
- escalation replaces reasoning
- bad changes persist because they are “almost done”
- teams drift into hero mode

Most damaging changes are not bad ideas.  
They are good ideas that were not stopped in time.

---

## Kill Criteria and sunk cost

Kill Criteria explicitly counter **sunk cost fallacy**.

Once a Kill Criterion is met:
- prior effort is irrelevant
- progress does not justify continuation
- stopping is success, not failure

Governance exists to enable stopping.

---

## Common Kill Criteria categories

Kill Criteria may be defined based on:

- violated constraints or invariants
- unacceptable business impact
- performance degradation beyond tolerance
- operational instability
- unexpected scope expansion
- new regulatory or compliance risk
- inability to observe or verify Intent

Not all Kill Criteria are technical.

---

## Kill Criteria vs risks

Risks describe *what might happen*.

Kill Criteria define *what happens if it does*.

A risk without a Kill Criterion invites rationalization.

---

## Kill Criteria and ownership

Kill Criteria must have:
- a clear owner empowered to stop the Change
- explicit authority to override momentum
- protection from blame for stopping

Stopping a Change requires more courage than continuing it.

---

## Kill Criteria under pressure

Kill Criteria matter most under urgency.

During incidents or high-pressure situations:
- teams default to action
- escalation accelerates
- reflection is suppressed

Predefined Kill Criteria reintroduce boundaries when thinking degrades.

---

## Minimal Kill Criteria definition

Kill Criteria do not need to be exhaustive.

A minimal definition may include:
- 1–3 explicit stop conditions
- a clear owner
- a decision path when triggered

Clarity matters more than completeness.

---

## Kill Criteria and Change Lifecycle

Kill Criteria may be evaluated at any stage:
- during execution
- during observation
- after partial rollout

Triggering Kill Criteria is a valid lifecycle outcome.

---

## Kill Criteria and incidents

Incidents often reveal missing Kill Criteria.

Post-incident analysis should ask:
- should this Change have been stopped earlier?
- which Kill Criteria were missing?
- who would have had authority to stop it?

Incidents without Kill Criteria analysis lose value.

---

## Final note

Continuing a Change is easy.

Stopping it is governance.

Kill Criteria exist to make stopping possible.
