# What CIMP Is Not

CIMP is intentionally limited.

Its power comes not from what it tries to do, but from what it **refuses** to do.

This document defines the boundaries of CIMP.

---

## CIMP is not automation

CIMP does not automate decisions.

It does not decide *what* to change, *when* to change, or *who* is responsible.

Automation without intent only accelerates failure.

CIMP exists to make intent explicit **before** automation happens.

---

## CIMP is not a CI/CD or delivery system

CIMP does not build, test, deploy, or release software.

It does not replace:
- CI pipelines
- deployment tools
- infrastructure orchestration
- release processes

CIMP operates **above** execution, not inside it.

---

## CIMP is not project management

CIMP does not manage:
- tasks
- sprints
- backlogs
- timelines
- velocity

It does not optimize throughput.

CIMP optimizes **decision quality under change**.

---

## CIMP is not documentation for its own sake

CIMP does not exist to produce documents.

If a Change Plan does not influence how a change is made, it has failed.

Documentation in CIMP is a **means of alignment**, not an artifact to archive.

---

## CIMP is not a replacement for engineering judgment

CIMP does not remove responsibility from engineers, architects, or operators.

It does not guarantee correctness.

It does not prevent mistakes.

CIMP makes responsibility **visible and explicit**.

---

## CIMP is not an AI product

CIMP does not require AI.

It does not depend on machine learning models.

It does not promise prediction or optimization through AI.

AI may assist CIMP implementations in the future,  
but CIMP is conceptually complete without it.

---

## CIMP is not a silver bullet

CIMP does not:
- eliminate risk
- remove uncertainty
- prevent all incidents
- make systems “safe by default”

CIMP makes trade-offs **conscious**.

---

## CIMP is not neutral

CIMP has values.

It favors:
- explicit intent over implicit action
- accountability over convenience
- boundaries over flexibility
- memory over forgetting

If these values conflict with your culture, CIMP will feel uncomfortable.

That discomfort is intentional.

---

## CIMP does not replace culture

CIMP cannot fix:
- broken incentives
- fear-driven organizations
- lack of ownership
- avoidance of responsibility

It can expose these problems.

It cannot solve them for you.

---

## Final boundary

If you are looking for:
- faster feature delivery
- fewer meetings
- less thinking
- automated safety

CIMP is not for you.

If you are willing to:
- slow down decisions to move faster overall
- make intent explicit
- accept responsibility for change

CIMP may be useful.
