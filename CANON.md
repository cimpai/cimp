# CIMP Canon v1.0

This document fixes **CIMP Canon v1.0**.

The canon defines the **stable conceptual core** of CIMP.
Everything outside this scope is allowed to evolve.

---

## What the Canon is

The CIMP Canon is a **system of concepts, definitions, and principles**
that governs how changes are understood, evaluated, and remembered
in complex systems.

The canon defines:
- how Intent is formed
- how Change is bounded and governed
- how Incidents are understood
- how Decisions and assumptions are preserved over time

The canon does **not** define tools, processes, or implementations.

## What is explicitly not canon

The following are **not** part of the canon:

- templates and checklists
- examples and case studies
- tools and automation
- implementation details
- organizational processes
- workflows or approval models

These may evolve independently and must not redefine canonical concepts.

---

## Stability guarantees

For Canon v1.0:

- core concepts are considered **stable**
- terminology is fixed
- meanings must not drift silently
- changes require explicit governance

Any modification to canonical meaning requires:
- an explicit proposal
- documented rationale
- a versioned canon update

---

## Versioning

- Canon versions are immutable once fixed
- Amendments require a new canon version (e.g. v1.1, v2.0)
- Minor clarifications without semantic change may be documented separately

A canon version reflects **conceptual stability**, not project maturity.

---

## Authority and governance

Canon evolution is governed by `GOVERNANCE.md`.

No single document may override the canon by implication.

Disagreements must be resolved by:
- clarifying concepts
- or explicitly versioning change

---

## Final note

The canon exists to outlive individuals, teams, and tools.

If applied consistently,  
CIMP Canon v1.0 should make systems **safer to change over time**.
